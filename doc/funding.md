# Funding

The EEGsynth project is non-commercial and has been developed by us in our own time and with limited (self-)funding.

However, we are very grateful to have received financial support from [Innovativ Kultur](http://www.innovativkultur.se/), [The Swedish Arts Grant Council](http://www.kulturradet.se/en/in-english/), [Kulturbryggan](http://www.konstnarsnamnden.se/default.aspx?id=18477) and [Stockholm County Council](http://www.sll.se/om-landstinget/Information-in-English1/).
