# Ini files

Every module directory contains an initialization file, which has the same name as the module and an `.ini` extention. The initialisation file is a text file, formatted according to Pythonâ€™s [configparser class](https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html). You can easily edit the files with any text editor. The text is organized in fields defined between square brackets (e.g., `[general]`), followed by settings that ... with an equal sign (e.g., `debug=1`).

The `.ini` file contains all the settings of a module. Some fields occur specific for a module, while many occur in almost all modules. We will discuss the latter below. Information about module specific configurations can be found in the _README.md_ in the module directory.

## `[general]`

`delay` sets the delay between each iteration of the module's internal loop, defined in seconds. A value of 0.05 means that the module will run through one iteration - e.g., calculate and output its results - 20 times per second. In our personal experience, this seems to be a reasonable trade-off between load and performance.

`debug` sets the degree of output send to the terminal for debugging purposes. A value of 0 will not output any debugging information, with values from 1 to 3 it will progressively add more, depending on the module.

## `[fieldtrip]`

The EEGsynth uses the [FieldTrip buffer](buffer.md) to communicate data (e.g., several EEG channels) between modules. Note that the following settings have to be consistent with the ini file of the buffer module.

`hostname` specifies the location of the FieldTrip buffer server. In the typical scenario when everything runs locally, use: `hostname=localhost`

`port` sets the port number of the FieldTrip server. For historical purposes, we typically set it as: `port=1972`

## `[redis]`

The EEGsynth uses a [Redis database](https://redis.io) to communicate _control signals_, which are any discrete values that are set and read by the modules. Note that the following settings have to be consistent with the configuration of the Redis server (see [installation](installation.md)).

`hostname` specifies the location of the FieldTrip buffer server. In the typical scenario when everything runs locally, use: `hostname=localhost`

`port` sets the port number of the FieldTrip server. Conventionally, we typically set it as: `port=6379`

## `[output]`

Most modules output values (back to) the Redis database to be used by other modules. In the output field you can specify the name under which they are written to the Redis database. Often this happens by prefixing or postfixing an input, as e.g., `spectral.channel1.alpha` by the spectral module:

`prefix=spectral`

## Manual control

Although the purpose of the EEGsynth (and BCIs in general) is to control devices using biological signals, some manual interaction might be desired, e.g., to adjust the dynamics of the output or to select the frequency range of the brainsignal during the recording. However, as with analogue synthesizers, we like the tactile real-time aspect of knobs and buttons, but would like to avoid using a computer keyboard. We therefore mainly use MIDI controllers, such as the [LaunchControl XL](https://global.novationmusic.com/launch/launch-control-xl) displayed below. Identical to all other modules, the launchcontrol _module_ records the launchcontrol input from sliders, knobs, and buttons into the Redis database to be used by other modules.
