# Launch Control

The Novation Launch Control XL and Launch Control mini are MIDI control surfaces that connect to the computer over USB. They feature a bunch of buttons and knobs, and on the XL also sliders. We often use them for online adjustment of parameters, or to toggle some algorithm on or off. See also the documentation on [manual control](manual-control.md).

As an alternative to a hardware controller, you can also use the [inputcontrol](../src/module/inputcontrol) module, which provides a configurable graphical user interface on the computer screen.

## Switch the Launch Control XL to low-power mode

To use the Launch Control XL connected directly (without powered USB hub) with the Raspberry Pi, you must first switch it to low-power mode. To do this hold down both the _User_ and _Factory Template_ buttons and insert the USB cable. Release the buttons and press _Record Arm_. Finally press the right arrow button.
