# Patching

In the EEGsynth, each module runs independently (in parallel), performing a specific function and communicating the result with each other. There is a great benefit in allowing modules to run independently, in their own time (anachronistically). In this way, some modules can run fast (e.g., pulling new data from an external device, and putting it in the data buffer), while others can run at a slower pace, e.g., calculating power over second-long windows.

A basic patch for example could have the following modules running in parallel:

- The [Redis server](redis.md) to communicate _control signals_ between modules
- The [Buffer server](buffer.md) to communicate _data_ between modules
- The [OpenBCI module](openbci.md) reading new ECG data from an OpenBCI board and placing it in the _data_ buffer
- The [heartrate module](../src/module/heartrate) reading new ECG data from the data buffer and sending the heart rate as a _control signal_ to Redis
- The [generateclock module](../src/module/generateclock) sending regular triggers through MIDI to a sequencer, with the speed dependent on the heart rate read from Redis

As you can see here, there are two ways in which the modules communicate, depending on whether **data** or **control signals** are communicated. This is a similar distinction as made in e.g., [Pure Data](https://puredata.info) (software) or modular synthesizers (hardware).

Below you can see an (already outdated) collection of modules, showing the two different ways of communication: via the data buffer (in yellow) and via the Redis database (control values in blue).

## Control signal communication

In the EEGsynth patching (communication) between modules is implemented through a [Redis database](redis.md). Interactions with Redis - which fields to read and where to write - are specified in each module's [ini file](inifile.md). For example, the [spectral module](../src/module/spectral), this might read from Redis the frequency bands in Hz, and write its output (power in those frequency bands) back into Redis. Or, to take the above example, the [generateclock module](../src/module/generateclock) will read from Redis the heartrate in seconds. It might output triggers directly to [MIDI](midi.md) as well as send pub/sub events back to Redis. Read more about how the EEGsynth uses Redis [here](redis.md).

## Data communication

Data is communicated from devices to - and between - modules using the [FieldTrip buffer](buffer.md).

## Editing and organizing your patches

Each module directory contains an ini file in their respective directory, with a filename identical to the module. e.g., [module/spectral](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/tree/master/src/module/spectral) contains [spectral.py](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/blob/master/src/module/spectral/spectral.py) and [spectral.ini](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/blob/master/src/module/spectral/spectral.ini). This example ini file lists the required fields and shows some default values. However, we highly recommend you save your edited [ini files](inifile.md) in a separate patch directory, such as [here](../patches/robinson). In this patch directory you store all the `.ini` files belonging to one patch. You can then also more easily Bash script you modules so that you don't have to start them up one by one. [Here](../patches/robinson/patch.sh) you can find an example to start a complete patch at once in Linux.

Collecting the necessary [ini files](inifile.md) in one place helps organizing your patches, as well as your local git repository, which will then not create annoying conflicts with the remote repository whenever you want to update. You can find several examples of patch directories in the [patches directory](../patches). These also serve as documentation of past performances.
