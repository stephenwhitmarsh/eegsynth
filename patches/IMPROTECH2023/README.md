# Patch for BBDMI workshop May 23th

This patch was used for the BBDMI workshop at MSH on March 23nd of 2022. It outputs power in different frequency bands at different electrodes locations (using a new montage functionality in the preprocessing) as features for ambisonic synthesis in MAX, using OSC signals. It makes use of LSL to transfer EEG data from the Mentalab Explore.
