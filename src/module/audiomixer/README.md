# Audiomixer module

This module mixes audio from an input to an output. It can for example be used for stereo panning, but also to create rotating sounds with a quadraphonic setup consisting of four or more speakers. It plays well with a look-up-table (LUT) that can be implemented using the `quiantizer` module.
