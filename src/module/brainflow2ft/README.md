# brainflow2ft module

The purpose of this module is to read real-time data from any EEG system supported by [BrainFlow](https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/) and to write it to the FieldTrip buffer. Other modules can read it from the buffer and analyze/convert/process it.

# Requirements

The FieldTrip buffer should be running prior to starting this module.
