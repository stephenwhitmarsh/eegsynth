[input]
; the input control value is mapped sequentially along the edges of geometrical shape with N edges/vertices
; the output control value is assigned to each of the vertices, relative to the proximity to that vertex
channel=launchcontrol.control077

[output]
; the output for vertex N is written to "geomixer.launchcontrol.control077.vertexN", where N is 1, 2, 3, etc
