# Plotimage

This module shows bitmap images on screen, which change according to the triggers that are configured for each image. It can be used for stimulus presentation and for giving participants instructions. We recommend making the stimulus material in Powerpoint and to export it as a series of bitmaps, i.e., one bitmap per slide.
