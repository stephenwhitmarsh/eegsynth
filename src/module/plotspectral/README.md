# Spectral Plotting Module

The purpose of this module is to visualize the spectrum content of a signal in realtime.  The displayed spectrum has some smoothing for smooth fluctuations over time.

It has added functionality for display and control: two frequency bands (red and blue) can be selected visually (e.g., using a LaunchControl) by setting their center and bandwidth. These frequencybands are updated in Redis, allowing real-time control of the frequency band of spectral analysis (spectral module).
